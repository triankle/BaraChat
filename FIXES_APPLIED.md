# Fixes Applied to Enable Message Sending

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Asyncio Event Loop Issues**
**Problem:** `RuntimeError: no running event loop` when trying to send messages.

**Solution:** Created an `AsyncWorker` QThread class that runs an asyncio event loop in the background. This allows async operations to run properly alongside Qt's event loop.

**Changes:**
- Added `AsyncWorker` class that manages asyncio in a separate thread
- Modified `app_window.py` to use `schedule_coroutine()` for all async operations
- Fixed `send_message()` to properly schedule async coroutines
- Added thread-safe UI updates using `QTimer.singleShot()`

### 2. **Server Message Format**
**Problem:** Server wasn't including all required message fields.

**Solution:** Updated server to include `type` and `timestamp` fields in broadcasted messages.

**Changes:**
- Modified `server/main.py` to include timestamp in message payload
- Added `type` field to match client expectations

### 3. **WebSocket Connection Flow**
**Problem:** Async connection logic wasn't properly integrated with Qt.

**Solution:** Implemented proper callback-based connection flow with thread-safe UI updates.

**Changes:**
- Added `_on_websocket_connected()` callback
- Made `_connect_websocket()` properly await async operations
- Added proper error handling

## How It Works Now

### Message Flow:
1. User types message in GUI → `chat_view.py` → `send_message()`
2. `send_message()` schedules async coroutine via `AsyncWorker`
3. `_send_message_async()` runs in background thread
4. Message sent via WebSocket to server
5. Server broadcasts to all clients in room
6. Client receives via `_on_message_received()` callback
7. UI updated on main thread using `QTimer`

### Architecture:
```
GUI Thread (Qt) ←→ AsyncWorker Thread (asyncio) ←→ NetworkClient ←→ Server
```

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python server/main.py
   ```

2. **Start a client:**
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```

3. **In the client:**
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Enter username
   - Click "Connect"
   - Switch to Chat tab
   - Select a room
   - Type a message and press Enter

4. **Start another client to test:**
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```
   (Use different username and chat between the two clients)

## Files Modified

- `client/gui/app_window.py` - Added AsyncWorker and fixed async integration
- `server/main.py` - Added timestamp and type fields to messages

## Status

✅ **Fixed:** Message sending now works properly!
✅ **Fixed:** Async operations properly integrated with Qt
✅ **Fixed:** Thread-safe UI updates
✅ **Fixed:** Proper WebSocket connection handling
