```

  ðŸ”Š Voice Channel 1

ðŸ“¢ ROOM-2
  ðŸ’¬ General Text
  ðŸ”Š Voice Channel 1
```

    "room-1": ["General Text", "Voice Channel 1"],
    "room-2": ["General Text", "Voice Channel 1"]
}
```

### Key Methods:
- `_join_text_channel()` - Switch to text chat
- `_join_voice_channel()` - Join voice and switch to Voice tab
