# Message Display Fix

## Problem
Messages sent in the chat were not appearing in the chat window.

## Root Cause
Messages were being sent to the server correctly, but:
1. The UI wasn't showing messages immediately when sent
2. The WebSocket message reception wasn't properly updating the UI
3. There was no immediate visual feedback for the user

## Solution

### 1. **Immediate Message Display**
When a message is sent, it now appears immediately in the chat window for instant feedback.

**Changes in `client/gui/app_window.py`:**
```python
def send_message(self, text: str):
    # Show message immediately in the UI
    self.chat_view.add_message(self.username, text, 0)
    
    # Then send to server
    self.async_worker.schedule_coroutine(self._send_message_async(text))
```

### 2. **Proper Signal-Based UI Updates**
Messages received from other users (via WebSocket) now use Qt signals for thread-safe UI updates.

**Changes:**
- Added `message_received` signal to `AppWindow`
- Created `_handle_message_received()` method to handle signal
- Modified `_on_message_received()` to emit signal instead of using QTimer

### 3. **Avoid Duplicate Messages**
Since we show messages immediately when sending, we filter out the same message when it comes back from the server.

**Changes:**
```python
async def _on_message_received(self, data: dict):
    user = data.get('user', 'unknown')
    # Only show if it's not from the current user
    if user != self.username:
        self.message_received.emit(user, text, timestamp)
```

### 4. **Added Debug Logging**
Added logging to help debug WebSocket message flow.

**Changes in `client/core/network.py`:**
- Log when messages are received
- Log when WebSocket messages are parsed
- Handle JSON decode errors gracefully

## How It Works Now

### Message Flow:

1. **User sends message:**
   - User types message and presses Enter
   - Message appears immediately in chat (instant feedback)
   - Message is sent to server via WebSocket

2. **Server broadcasts:**
   - Server receives message
   - Broadcasts to all clients in the room (including sender)

3. **Other users receive:**
   - Their WebSocket receives the broadcast
   - Message is displayed in their chat window

4. **Current user:**
   - Message not shown again (to avoid duplicate)
   - But could be updated if needed (e.g., "sending..." → "sent")

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server/main.py
   ```

2. Start client 1:
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```
   - Login as "Alice"
   - Type and send a message

3. Start client 2:
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```
   - Login as "Bob"
   - You should see Alice's message
   - Type a message - Alice should see it

## Files Modified

- `client/gui/app_window.py` - Added immediate message display, signals for thread-safe updates
- `client/core/network.py` - Added debug logging for WebSocket messages

## Status

✅ **Fixed:** Messages now appear immediately when sent
✅ **Fixed:** Proper thread-safe UI updates using Qt signals
✅ **Fixed:** No duplicate messages
✅ **Fixed:** Added debug logging for troubleshooting

You can now chat and see messages appear in real-time!
