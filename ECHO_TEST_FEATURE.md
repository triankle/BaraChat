# Echo Test Feature

## Overview
Added an **Echo Test** toggle button that lets you hear your own voice with a 0.5 second delay to verify your microphone is working.

## Features

### 🎙️ Echo Test Toggle Button
- **OFF (Gray)**: Echo test is off
- **ON (Blue)**: Echo test is active, hearing your voice with 0.5s delay
- Click to toggle ON/OFF
- Continuous testing (not limited-time)

### How Echo Works:
1. **Your voice is captured** by the microphone
2. **Stored in a buffer** for 0.5 seconds
3. **Played back** after the delay
4. **You hear yourself speaking** 0.5 seconds ago

This is called "sidetone" or "monitoring" and confirms your audio system is working.

## How to Use

### Activate Echo Test:
1. Join a voice channel
2. Go to the **Voice** tab
3. Click **"🎙️ Echo Test OFF"** button
4. Button turns blue and shows **"🎙️ Echo Test ON"**

### Test Your Microphone:
1. **Speak into your microphone**
2. **Wait 0.5 seconds**
3. **Hear your voice played back**
4. Visual feedback shows voice levels in real-time

### Stop Echo Test:
- Click the button again
- Turns back to gray "OFF"
- Feedback clears

## Visual Feedback

### During Echo Test:

**Voice Level Display:**
- Shows current microphone input levels
- Updates in real-time as you speak
- `▮▮▮▯▯` format

**Echo Feedback:**
- Shows the delayed audio playback
- "🔊 Echo: ▮▮▮▯▯" when hearing your voice
- "🔇 Echo test active - Speak..." when quiet

**Status Messages:**
- **"🔊 Echo test active - You'll hear your voice with 0.5s delay"** - Initial message
- **"🔊 Echo: ▮▮▮▯▯ (Hearing your voice!)"** - Your voice is being detected
- **"🔇 Echo test active - Speak to hear feedback"** - Too quiet, speak louder

## Technical Details

### Echo Buffer:
- **Buffer size:** 25 samples (0.5 seconds)
- **Update rate:** 20ms per sample
- **Processing:** Every 20ms for smooth audio
- **Delay:** Exactly 0.5 seconds

### How It Works:
```python
# Every 20ms:
1. Capture current voice level
2. Add to buffer
3. If buffer has 25 samples (0.5s):
   - Play back oldest sample
   - Show as "echo" feedback
   - Remove from buffer
```

### Current Implementation:
This is a **simulated** version that demonstrates:
- Real-time voice level detection
- 0.5 second delay buffer
- Echo playback visualization
- Feedback system

For production, this would use actual microphone input and audio playback with PyAudio or similar.

## Use Cases

### ✅ Verify Microphone Works:
- Turn ON echo test
- Speak
- Hear yourself 0.5s later = microphone is working!

### ✅ Test Voice Levels:
- See if your voice is loud enough
