# WebSocket Connection Fixes

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **`.closed` Attribute Error**
**Error:** `'ClientConnection' object has no attribute 'closed'`

**Root Cause:** The websockets library's connection objects don't have a `.closed` attribute. We were incorrectly checking `self.websocket.closed`.

**Solution:** Removed the `.closed` check and simplified the WebSocket connection logic. The library handles connection state internally.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `self.websocket.closed` check in `send_message()`
- Simplified `_listen_messages()` to use `async for message in self.websocket` pattern
- Added proper error handling for disconnect

### 2. **Unclosed Session Warnings**
**Error:** `Unclosed client session`

**Root Cause:** The aiohttp ClientSession wasn't being properly closed on disconnect.

**Solution:** Added try-except blocks in `disconnect()` method to ensure proper cleanup even if errors occur.

**Changes Made:**
- Wrapped WebSocket close in try-except
- Wrapped session close in try-except
- Both operations now safely handle errors

### 3. **Thread Cleanup**
**Issue:** AsyncWorker thread not properly terminated when application closes.

**Solution:** Added proper cleanup in `closeEvent()` that gracefully stops the event loop.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `closeEvent()` to stop the asyncio event loop
- Added proper cleanup logic with timeouts
- Made AsyncWorker properly handle exceptions

## Files Modified

1. **client/core/network.py:**
   - Removed `.closed` attribute checks
   - Changed `_listen_messages()` to use `async for` pattern
   - Improved `disconnect()` error handling
   - Simplified `send_message()` to only check if websocket exists

2. **client/gui/app_window.py:**
   - Improved AsyncWorker cleanup
   - Added proper error handling in `run()`
   - Improved `closeEvent()` to properly stop event loop
   - Added graceful shutdown with timeout

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

```bash
# Start server
python server/main.py

# Start client
python client/main.py
```

You should now be able to:
- Connect without errors
- Send messages
- Receive messages
- Close the application without warnings

## Status

✅ **Fixed:** WebSocket `.closed` attribute error
✅ **Fixed:** Unclosed session warnings
✅ **Fixed:** Thread cleanup on exit
✅ **Fixed:** Proper async/await integration

The application should now work smoothly without connection errors!
