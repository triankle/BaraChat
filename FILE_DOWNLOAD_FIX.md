# File Download Feature - Fixed

## Problem
Files couldn't be downloaded because QTextEdit doesn't support clickable links.

## Solution
Added a **ðŸ“¥ Download** button at the bottom of the chat that:
- Shows the last file URL
- Downloads files directly when clicked
- Saves to your Downloads folder
- Provides feedback on download status

## How to Use

### Upload and Download Files:

1. **Upload a file:**
   - Click the ðŸ“Ž button
   - Select a file
   - File is uploaded

2. **Download a file:**
   - See "Last file: [URL]" at the bottom of chat
   - Click **ðŸ“¥ Download** button
   - File downloads to your Downloads folder
   - See confirmation message

## UI Elements

### Download Bar (bottom of chat):
```
Last file: http://127.0.0.1:8765/download/photo.jpg  [ðŸ“¥ Download]
```

- **Gray when disabled** - No file available
- **Green when ready** - Click to download
- **URL is selectable** - You can copy it

### In Chat Message:
