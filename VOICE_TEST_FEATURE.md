2. The button turns yellow and shows "🎙️ Testing..."
3. **Speak into your microphone** for 3 seconds

### To Test Your Voice:
1. Join a voice channel
2. Go to the **Voice** tab
3. Click **"🎙️ Test Voice"**

5. Watch the voice level indicator

### Troubleshooting:

**If "No voice detected":**
- Check microphone is plugged in
- Check microphone permissions in Windows
- Check microphone volume in Windows settings
- Try speaking louder

**If voice is working:**

## Implementation

The test simulates voice detection by:
1. Checking voice level every 100ms
2. Updating the visual indicator
3. Providing real-time feedback
4. Showing final result after 3 seconds

In production, this would connect to actual microphone input using PyAudio or similar library.
