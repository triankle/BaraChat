# Voice Channel Feature

## Overview
BaraChat now includes voice channel support! You can participate in voice conversations alongside text chat.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Voice Channel UI**: Beautiful interface with status indicators
- **Push-to-Talk**: Hold the button to talk
- **Mute/Unmute**: Toggle audio on/off
- **Room Switching**: Voice panel shows current room
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators for speaking/muted states

### ðŸ”¶ Ready for Integration (WebRTC)
The UI is complete and ready to be connected to WebRTC audio streaming. The following components are prepared:
- Voice signaling WebSocket endpoint (`/voice`)
- Voice panel signals and events
- Room-based voice channels

## How to Use

### Basic Voice Chat:
1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python server/main.py
   ```

2. **Start the client:**
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```

3. **In the client:**
   - Go to Settings tab â†’ Enter username â†’ Click Connect
   - Switch to **Voice** tab
   - You'll see:
     - Status indicator (green = active, yellow = muted)
     - Current room indicator
     - Mute button
     - Press-to-Talk button

4. **Using Push-to-Talk:**
   - Press and hold the red "ðŸŽ¤ Press to Talk" button
   - Speak while holding the button
   - Release to stop

5. **Muting:**
   - Click the "ðŸ”Š Mute" button to mute your microphone
   - Status will turn yellow
   - Click again to unmute

## UI Features

### Status Indicators:
- **Green**: Voice channel active and unmuted
- **Yellow**: Voice channel muted
- **Red "Press to Talk"**: Ready to transmit
- **Green "Talking..."**: Currently transmitting

### Voice Panel Controls:
- **Mute Button**: Toggle microphone on/off
- **Push-to-Talk**: Hold to speak (prevents accidental transmission)
- **Room Display**: Shows which room you're connected to
- **Status Label**: Real-time connection status

## Room Switching
- When you switch rooms, the voice panel automatically updates
- Each room maintains its own voice channel
- Conversation history is preserved when switching rooms

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Complete:
- Voice UI with all controls
- Push-to-talk functionality
- Mute/unmute with visual feedback
- Room-based voice channels
- Signal event handling in main window

### ðŸ”¶ Ready for WebRTC Integration:
The UI is ready for WebRTC connection. To complete voice functionality:

1. **Install WebRTC audio libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install aiortc pyaudio
   ```

2. **Connect voice panel signals to audio capture:**
   - `voice_start` â†’ Start microphone
   - `voice_stop` â†’ Stop microphone
   - `mute_toggled` â†’ Control audio output

3. **Implement WebRTC peer connections:**
   - Connect to `/voice` WebSocket
   - Handle SDP offers/answers
   - Exchange ICE candidates
   - Stream audio via WebRTC

## Architecture

### Voice Flow:
```
User presses PTT â†’ Voice Panel â†’ App Window â†’ Network Client â†’ Server
                                                         â†“
                                            WebSocket (signaling)
                                                         â†“
                                            WebRTC (audio streaming)
```

### Files Modified:
- `client/gui/voice_panel.py` - Complete voice UI with controls
- `client/gui/app_window.py` - Voice tab integration and signal handlers
- `server/main.py` - Added `/voice` signaling endpoint

## Testing

1. **UI Testing (Current):**
   ```bash
   python client/main.py
   ```
   - Switch to Voice tab
   - Click buttons and verify status changes
   - Switch rooms and verify room indicator updates

2. **Full Voice Testing (Requires WebRTC):**
   - Will require WebRTC implementation
   - Will need microphone access permissions
   - Will require audio playback device

## Future Enhancements

- Full WebRTC audio streaming
- Voice activity detection (auto-speak)
- Voice quality indicators
- Multiple audio codec support
- 3D spatial audio effects
- Voice recording and playback
- Cross-platform compatibility
